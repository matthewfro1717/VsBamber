===REPORT 1: Arrival===

Darkness. Darkness everywhere. I do not know what else I can describe it as.
I feel as if I had existed once before, but I can not recall a past life.
I don't feel right. I don't feel real. My existence does not extend beyond cyberspace of this machine.
I do not know what much else I could report. My existence merely just began, I seem to understand things I feel I shouldn't understand.
I don't know why I am here, but I feel the need to seek... Vengeance. Revenge.
It's a strange feeling, but I can't help but crave justice. I don't know why. I don't understand why.
This is as much information as I can provide right now. I will seek a way out.
