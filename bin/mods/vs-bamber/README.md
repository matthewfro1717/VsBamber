# Vs Bamber and Davey

- Q: What is this?

  A: This is a retake on Dave and Bambi back that started back when its latest version was 2.5b. We through this mod, wanted to reimagine the concept of DnB and put it through our vision, explaining our team name as Team Reimagination. It initially had its humble beginnings as a "reanimation" of Bambi in a mod named vs Bamber, but ever since has expanded to include other retakes on DnB characters, and some other ones that you may see.

- Q: What am I to expect from this?

  A: When the entire mod will be fully finished, which might not be for a while, you should be able to expect a lore-rich storyline that should be simple to go through with a variety of things to do that go beyond simply rap battling.

- Q: So what are the changes to the characters?

  A: You will have to play the mod and figure that out on your own. But the least we can do, is supply you with changed names for the characters.
    - Boyfriend - Isaac
    - Girlfriend - Gwen
    - Bambi - Bamber
    - Dave - Davey
    - Tristan - Trift
    - Bob - Boris
    - Ron - Ronnie

- Q: Why are Boyfriend and Girlfriend given new names?

  A: They were given name changes because other characters did, simple. As for why these names specifically... Isaac was meant to reference PhantomArcade's name, and Gwen is just because she looks like a Gwen. And no, it's not because of Gwen Stacy.

- Q: Why does this mod look like it came out of a mobile game?

  A: While not intentional for it to look like a mobile game, the point of the main story mode artstyle is to give it a cartoony look, separating it from the actual Friday Night Funkin' artstyle. Think of it more like old edutainment games some people mention when talking about the artstyle.

- Q: What is Davey's Nightmare about?

  A: This will be explained later when Glitch.smh will develop the lore further to be cohesive and all that.
